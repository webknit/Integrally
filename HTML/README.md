## Set up
- Need to ensure you have everything on your machine
	- Ruby 
	- Grunt
	- etc
- To install the gems we do 'gem install bundler' the install the bundle 'bundle install'
- 'npm install' to install everything (mighe need sudo)
- 'grunt' to run it


## What SASS goes where?
- The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.
- The partials directory is where most of the CSS is constructed. The base styles are predefined at top level and then deeper folders are created as per your project requirements.

 
## Naming the folders
We currently have two folders assets and site. 
To help assist with the BE implementation we can rename the folders to match the project e.g.

- JNPR.Assets
- JNPR.Site
